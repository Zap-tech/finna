/finna is still in early development, expect things to change/


*finna* is a tool to quickly and easily read to and write smart
contracts on the ethereum blockchain, and much more. *finna* runs in
the browser and is powered by [[https://github.com/benzap/fif][fif]], a stack-based scripting language.

Here is an example of *finna* in action

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

;; finna - An Ethereum Blockchain Scratchpad

;; Some user address that we're interested in
let some-address "0xad7ad87afdafdaf8d7afd8af7d"


;; Let's look at how much eth it has
"some-address has " . (account/balance some-address)$ to-eth . " ETH" . cr


;; This uses etherscan to retrieve the contract ABI functions
let some-erc20-coin "0x32049328432098523059"
(contract/call some-erc20-coin :approve [some-address 10 to-wei]?)$
tx/wait-for ;; Wait for the returned transaction to complete

;; Now that it's populated, this will transfer the given ERC20 coin
;; from the provider (metamask, coinbase, etc) to the given address.
(contract/call some-erc20-coin :transfer-from [some-address 10 to-wei]?)$ tx/wait-for

;; The appropriate prompts will appear to carry out the transaction

;; Assuming the account had no tokens previously, let's now confirm
;; that the transfer completed successfully (there are better ways to
;; do this, this is just a proof of concept)
(contract/call some-erc20-coin :get-balance [some-address])$ 10 to-wei >= if
  "Transfer Completed Successfully!" . cr
else
  "Transfer Failed, or hasn't completed yet!" . cr
then

;; Write word functions
fn approve [address amount] &
  (contract/call some-erc20-coin :approve [address amount] ?)$
endfn

(approve some-address 10 to-wei)$ tx/wait-for
