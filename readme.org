/finna is still in early development, expect things to change/


*finna* is a tool to quickly and easily read to and write smart
contracts on the ethereum blockchain, and much more. *finna* runs in
the browser and is powered by [[https://github.com/benzap/fif][fif]], a stack-based scripting language.

Here is an example of *finna* in action

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

;; finna - An Ethereum Blockchain Scratchpad

;; Some user address that we're interested in
let some-address "0xad7ad87afdafdaf8d7afd8af7d"


;; Let's look at how much eth it has
"some-address has " . (account/balance some-address)$ to-eth . " ETH" . cr


;; This uses etherscan to retrieve the contract ABI, which generates
;; members and methods within the `some-erc-20-coin` namespace.
(contract *some-erc20-coin "0x32049328432098523059")$


;; Now that it's populated, this will transfer the given ERC20 coin
;; from the provider (metamask, coinbase, etc) to the given address.
(some-erc20-coin/transferFrom account/default "0x898274923847239847" 1000.0)$


;; The appropriate prompts will appear to carry out the transaction


(sleep 30 1000 *)$ ;; Sleep for 30 seconds


;; Assuming the account had no tokens previously, let's now confirm
;; that the transfer completed successfully (there are better ways to
;; do this, this is just a proof of concept)
(some-erc20-coin/getBalance some-address)$ 1000 >= if
  "Transfer Completed Successfully!" . cr
else
  "Transfer Failed, or hasn't completed yet!" . cr
then
